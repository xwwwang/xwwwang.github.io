      description: "• Constructed panel data set of Environmental Policy Stringency Index from OECD with sector-level data from Orbis covering 
millions of global firms (2006-2015) using R and Stata.
• Concluded that firms' profit margins in heavy pollution sectors are significantly higher in countries with stronger 
environmental regulations using standard difference-in-difference approach with fixed effects.
• Addressed that the increase in firms’ profit margin may be the result of less competition due to stricter policy than the 
traditional thinking of Porter Hypothesis on a global scale using triple interaction term regression analysis"

    - title: "Weekend effect Report"
      description: "French (1979) discussed the weekend effect by comparing two different models of the process generating returns, which are the calendar time hypothesis and the trading time hypothesis. The calendar time hypothesis considers the process operates continuously, and, since the return for Monday represents a three-calendar day investment, the expected return for Monday will be three times as the other days. The trading time hypothesis considers the expected returns of everyday in a week is the same. Unexpectedly, this study has found that the expected return from 1953-1977 on Monday is negative, while the expected returns on all other days are positive. French believes these negative returns for Monday appear to be evidence of market inefficiency. In this study, we aim to examine if this effect of negative expected returns is still present in recent years, so that investors may be able to react and profit from this inefficiency."
